== About Twitter-Pictures-to-Tumblr ==
The Twitter-Pictures-to-Tumblr project comes from an idea @MrCippy (http://twitter.com/MrCippy - https://github.com/mrcippy) and I had. We wanted to aggregate pictures around a specific hashtag and post them to a website. We ended up using Tumblr as the service because its free and has an easy API to interface with. The downside is that tumblr only allows 75 posts a day so we've run into issues with the services stopping. Hopefully someone finds it useful and continues to expand on the project.

The project is based on PHP/MySQL. The MySQL database is used for catching duplicate photos so that they aren't posted again when someone retweet's something.

The project currently supports several of the more popular photo sharing services on twitter including: twitpic, yfrog, instagram, picplz and flickr. It's also able to check t.co shortened urls, foursquare pictures, and posterous.


== Install ==
I've tried my best to make this easy...

1. Download the source code to the project
2. Setup your MySQL Table using the table-structure.sql file
3. Setup your tumblr site
4. Edit the config.php file with the appropriate values
5. Setup a cron job to run the index.php file as often as you'd like
6. Hopefully the magic happens and pictures are posted to the tumblr blog
